The implementation is still incomplete and under development.

These are standard btcnano manipulation routines which should be
provided by any normal btcnano library in whatever language you choose.

The ones here are standalone ones taken from btcnano core and some I
wrote, many taken from btcnano-iterate and pasted in here.
